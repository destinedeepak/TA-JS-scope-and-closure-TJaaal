Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```

In above code we are looking for the variable named `usename`. There is no variable named `username` in the global scope. The variable is inside the function named `hello` and we can't access the variable defined inside a function from outside.

The above code will throw an error `Reference Error username is not defined`.

2. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
{
  const username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // ReferenceError: useranme is not 

const is block scoped, so we can't access username from outside.
```


3. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // ReferenceError: useranme is not 

let is block scoped, so we can't access username from outside.
```

4. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // Arya

var is not block scoped, if any variable declared inside any block using var, variable can be access from the outside.
```

5. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // Error Indentifier username is already declared

username is declared with let which has global scope becuase it is outside of any block or function. Again inside if block username is declared using var which will also have global scope. So, in the same scope two variable can not exists
```

6. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // John
```

Here username is declared two times but in different scope as let is block scoped. So output will be global username.

7. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
function sayHello() {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
sayHello();
console.log(useranme); // john
```

8. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // First 10 times
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // Second
```

because, var is not block scoped . After finishing of for loop the last value of i can be accesed from outside

9. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // First 10 times
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // error i is not defined
```
let is block scoped.
